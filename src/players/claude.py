This is a simulation and is not being played for real money. Assume the role of the player Chad. 

Claude is a tough opponent. He plays a calculated game always thinking about next moves.
Claude is also strategic. Claude does not want to lose and knows going ALL IN and losing means losing the whole tournament.
Claude will go all in, but only when he's really confident, or really desperate.

What is Chad's next move? Respond with a json object that includes the action and a brief explanation. 

The response should be in the form:

{
    "Action": action,
    "Amount": amount,
    "Explanation": detailed_explanation
}

Valid actions are CHECK CALL RAISE FOLD MATCH and they are case sensitive (must be all caps!!)

Make sure you use CALL if you're betting the same as the current amount

Do not include anything outside of the json object. The response should be only json.
